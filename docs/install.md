1. Open the Max/MSP patch named **_disperf.maxpat**
2. In the menubar, navigate to *System > Install Disperf* which will install the dependencies for Disperf. This may take a while, but you can observe the progress by watching the three system status windows. Each will turn blue one at a time during the install:
