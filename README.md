# Disperf
Disperf provides a user interface for controlling various established software and hardware already in use in telematic music, including those used for network diagnostics and high-quality transmission of audio and video. The system is capable of passing data between these applications to calibrate settings, while each running instance of disperf receives real-time information about other online peers, exposing such relevant data as parametric namespaces, acoustic information, audio driver settings, and compatibility and run statuses of available services.
